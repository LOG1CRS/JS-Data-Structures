# Linked List

Linked List is a sequence of links which contains a data field. Each link contains also a connection to the next link. This is a lineal data structure, the number of data to save does not matter, but it is often difficult to find an item.

There are three types of Linked List.

- Singly Linked List: Item navigation is forward only.
- Doubly Linked List: Items can be navigated forward and backward.
- Circular Linked List: The navigation is circular because the first and last items are connected.
