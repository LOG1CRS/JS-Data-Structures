# Stack

Stack is a linear data structure, also known as LIFO (Last In, First Out) that refers to the way of the data structure stores data. The stack saves the data by placing each item on top of other so you can only access the last added item and you can only save items at the end of the list.

You can understand stacks with real-life examples such as plates stacked over one another, the plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed and the plate that has been placed in the lowest position has to wait for the ones above to be removed.
