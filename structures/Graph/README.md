# Graph

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. There are different kinds of graphs:

- Undirected graph: They are the graphs where there are no directions at the edges that connect the nodes.
- Directed graph: They are the graphs where there are direction at the edges that connect the nodes.
- Cyclic graph: They are the graphs where all nodes must be connected to at least two other nodes allowing movement to all nodes.
- Acyclic graph: They are the graphs where some nodes are not connected to more than two nodes, avoiding movement to all nodes.
- Weighted graphs: They are the graphs where the edges that connect the nodes have a weight value, which represents the cost of a connection between two nodes.
- Unweighted graphs: They are the graphs where the edges that connect the nodes don't have weight value.
