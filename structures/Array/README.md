# Array

An array is a collection of information. When we create an array, it generates an index for each information that we saving inside consecutively. The array is also known in other programming languages ​​as a list. There are two types of arrays:

- Static Array: The size of the array is defined when the array is declared and after it cannot be changed, that size defines the maximum number of values ​​you can add to the array.
- Dynamic Array: You can add values as you want, without defining a number of values ​​you need.

JavaScript uses dynamic arrays and you don't need to declare the type of data to save because you can save all kinds of data as you want in any position. It is worth mentioning that the arrays are already pre-built in javascript to be able to use them immediately.
