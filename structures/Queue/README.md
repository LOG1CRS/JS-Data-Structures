# Queue

Queue is a linear data structure, also known as FIFO (First In, First Out) that refers to the way of the data structure stores data. The queue stores the data as a list where the first data to arrive is the first data to leave.

You can understand queues with a simple real-life example. Imagine a queue of customers waiting for a product, of course, the first customer to arrive is the first customer to receive the product and leave the queue, and the last customer to arrive must wait for the next customers in the queue who arrived before him and will be the last customer to leave the queue.
