This repo is a compilation of the fundamental data structures, and also helps me to have them present when I need them or forget something about them. Each structure contains notes and comments to explain better itself and Its code made with JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Inside the [structures folder](https://github.com/LOG1CRS/JS-Data-Structures/tree/main/structures), there are folders of each structure, and within each one, you will find a readme file explaining that structure, the code with comments, and a package.json file with the commands to run the code with node.

## What Are Data Structures?

<h4>Data structures are different ways of organizing data to save or use it effectively.</h4>

To explain it analogically, we can compare the data as clothes, if you had a pile of clothes you can organize it in different ways such as colors, type of clothes, stacked, hung and that helps you a find a specific garment when you need. On the contrary, if you don't organize it could be complicated to find a specific garment quickly.

_More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data._
